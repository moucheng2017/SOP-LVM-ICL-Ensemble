prompts: 
  system: > 
   Your job is write standard operating procedure (SOP) for a workflow, by merging the given pseudo labels of actions.
   The SOP should contain a numerated list of actions taken by the user to complete the given workflow.
   Read carefully the numerated pseudo labels, keep the common actions, fill the missing actions, then write the SOP.
  testing_example: >
    You are given the following pseudo labels of the workflow as priors to help you to write your SOP. 
    The pseudo label describes the chronological order of actions taken by the user to complete the workflow.
  question: >
    Given the pseudo labels of actions, write an SOP for completing the workflow. 
    The SOP should simply contain an enumerated list of actions taken by the user to complete the given workflow.
    In your SOP, list all of the actions taken (i.e., buttons clicked, fields entered, mouse scrolls etc.). 
    Be descriptive about elements (i.e., 'the subheading located under the "General" section'). 
    Use the location of the mouse to identify which exact elements were clicked.
    Stick with the format of the pseudo labels.
    Be as detailed as possible. Each step should be a discrete action that reflects what you see in the corresponding step. Don't skip steps.
    Don't include high level summaries or generalizations. 
    Please write your SOP below:
